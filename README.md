# Book-Advisor
Developed a simple MVC based java web application using Servlets and JSP where users can visit and select the type of book he/she is interested to buy. 
After selecting, the website will suggest 3 books for that type along with an Amazon link to buy a particular book. 

Servlet technology is used to create a web application (resides at server side and generates a dynamic web page).

JSP technology is used to create web application just like Servlet technology. It can be thought of as an extension to Servlet because it provides more functionality than servlet such as expression language, JSTL, etc.
